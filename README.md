# Enterprise Management System

  A wireless network in an enterprise enables devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets to connect to the corporate network wirelessly. An Access Point (AP) is used to facilitate this, and you may want to use a controller-based system to manage multiple APs in large environments.

  The implementation integrates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server for automated IP address assignment, reducing manual errors and improving operational efficiency. Port Security and Access Control Lists (ACLs) are configured to safeguard the network from unauthorized access, while Secure Shell (SSH) enables encrypted remote management. 
  
  Network Address Translation (NAT) Overload (PAT) ensures efficient use of public IP addresses and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide secure remote connectivity for healthcare professionals and administrators. Additionally, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) extends mobility for staff and devices, ensuring continuous service delivery.
